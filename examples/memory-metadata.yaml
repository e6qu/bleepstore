# BleepStore Configuration — Memory Metadata Backend
#
# This configuration stores all metadata (buckets, objects, uploads, credentials)
# in memory only. Data is lost on restart. Best for: Testing, CI, ephemeral data
#
# Data Location:
#   - Metadata: In-memory hash maps (RAM)
#   - Buckets:  HashMap<bucket_name, BucketRecord>
#   - Objects:   HashMap<(bucket, key), ObjectRecord>
#   - Uploads:   HashMap<upload_id, MultipartUploadRecord>
#   - Parts:     HashMap<(upload_id, part_number), PartRecord>
#   - Credentials: HashMap<access_key, CredentialRecord>
#
# Limitations:
#   - All metadata lost on restart
#   - Not suitable for production workloads
#   - Memory usage grows with number of objects
